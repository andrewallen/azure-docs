### New Azure AD sign-in experience

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD  
**Product capability:** User authentication
 
The Azure AD and Microsoft account identity system UIs were redesigned so that they have a consistent look and feel. In addition, the Azure AD sign-in page collects the user name first, followed by the credential on a second screen.

For more information, see [The new Azure AD sign-in experience is now in public preview](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/08/02/the-new-azure-ad-signin-experience-is-now-in-public-preview/).
 
---
 

### Fewer sign-in prompts: A new "keep me signed in" experience for Azure AD sign-in

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD  
**Product capability:** User authentication
 
The **Keep me signed in** check box on the Azure AD sign-in page was replaced with a new prompt that shows up after you successfully authenticate. 

If you respond **Yes** to this prompt, the service gives you a persistent refresh token. This behavior is the same as when you selected the **Keep me signed in** check box in the old experience. For federated tenants, this prompt shows after you successfully authenticate with the federated service.

For more information, see [Fewer sign-in prompts: The new "keep me signed in" experience for Azure AD is in preview](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/09/19/fewer-login-prompts-the-new-keep-me-signed-in-experience-for-azure-ad-is-in-preview/).

### Add configuration to require the terms of use to be expanded prior to accepting

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Terms of use  
**Product capability:** Governance
 
An option for administrators requires their users to expand the terms of use prior to accepting the terms.

Select either **On** or **Off** to require users to expand the terms of use. The **On** setting requires users to view the terms of use prior to accepting them.

For more information, see the [Azure AD terms of use feature (preview)](active-directory-tou.md).

### Scoped activation for eligible role assignments

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
You can use scoped activation to activate eligible Azure resource role assignments with less autonomy than the original assignment defaults. An example is if you're assigned as the owner of a subscription in your tenant. With scoped activation, you can activate the owner role for up to five resources contained within the subscription (such as resource groups and virtual machines). Scoping your activation might reduce the possibility of executing unwanted changes to critical Azure resources.

For more information, see [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure.md).

### Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication 


**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:**  Multi-factor authentication  
**Product capability:** User authentication




The Network Policy Server extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication adds cloud-based multi-factor authentication capabilities to your authentication infrastructure by using your existing servers.

You now can use "OR" (require one of the selected controls) for conditional access controls. You can use this feature to create policies with "OR" between access controls. For example, you can use this feature to create a policy that requires a user to sign in by using multi-factor authentication "OR" to be on a compliant device.

For more information, see [Controls in Azure AD conditional access](active-directory-conditional-access-controls.md).

 
---

### Aggregation of real-time risk events


**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Identity protection  
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection


In Azure AD Identity Protection, all real-time risk events that originated from the same IP address on a given day are now aggregated for each risk event type. This change limits the volume of risk events shown without any change in user security.

The underlying real-time detection works each time the user signs in. If you have a sign-in risk security policy set up to multi-factor authentication or block access, it is still triggered during each risky sign-in.

### Automatic sign-in field detection


**Type:** Fixed   
**Service category:** My Apps  
**Product capability:** Single sign-on  



Azure AD supports automatic sign-in field detection for applications that render an HTML user name and password field. These steps are documented in [How to automatically capture sign-in fields for an application](application-config-sso-problem-configure-password-sso-non-gallery.md#how-to-manually-capture-sign-in-fields-for-an-application). You can find this capability by adding a *Non-Gallery* application on the **Enterprise Applications** page in the [Azure portal](http://aad.portal.azure.com). Additionally, you can configure the **Single Sign-on** mode on this new application to **Password-based Single Sign-on**, enter a web URL, and then save the page.
